Driving in Hyheel is dangerous!
There are several incidents involving young people's pedals - Yahoo! News
violations of road traffic laws
It is a big mistake to think that it is a problem only for older drivers, although the number of reported accidents caused by malfunctions such as pedal mistakes is increasing.
The number of times-by-year-old pedal accident cases (2015 Police Agency data) showed that more than 1080 cases were less than 24 years old and 1032 over 75 years old.
It is important to call attention to young people as well.
do you take your feet?
are you safe?
Although this data does not include gender ratio or cause, it is likely that the elderly who are often considered to have a decline in the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, may be mistaken for other things such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as Heheel, Panps, Sandal, Mule, and others driving them.
Some people know that it's not suitable for driving, but some people think it's troublesome to change their shoes, but some people don't think that they can lead to danger.
However, driving on high-heel and sandals is against road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the steering wheel, brakes and other operations, Article 70, which stipulates that the operation should not be carried out to harm people with accidents.
Another reason is that the driver must comply with the provisions set forth by the National Security Committee of each prefecture, for example, in Article 12 of the Law on Road Traffic in Miyazaki Prefecture, "I wear shoes in a way that prevents driving operations, or wear them in a way that prevents the operation of the vehicle (excluding light vehicles).
The purpose of each prefecture is to consider a violation of the operation of "wear that can prevent driving operations" until it is not stated as Heheel.
Why is the driving in Heheel dangerous?
It is obvious to consider the basics of pedaling safely.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, the first leg is fixed to the floor, and the foot is placed perpendicular to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the accelerator pedal, it tilts to the right.
At this time, it is important to keep firmly fixed, regardless of car behavior.
However, it is difficult to adjust the size of the foot on the pedal to ensure that the surface of the foot is small and the surface of the floor is small, and that the area of the foot on the pedal is small, so it is difficult to adjust.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull the heel or heel, and when the brake is in a hurry, the pedal is pulled and the heel is pulled off, and the heel is pulled away, and the heels are removed, and the pedals are stuck in the back.
In addition, there are cases where heel is pulled to the back of the pedal and the accelerator pedal is not returned.

What is the image of a snake that overlaps with the beautiful girls of Baizu' work? - Yahoo!
Are you in common with mysterious beauty and shadows?
Since the 1950s, many works have been sent to the world.The collection of Baizuno Mi Girl (Genkosha) was released in August 2019.
When you take a look at it, you will notice the correlation between beauty and fear of the works of Baizu.
[Image] It is attractive because there is a shadow.
Five beautiful girls of the work without Baizu
In the preface of the "Mi Girl Collection," there was a sentence saying "The beauty of the horror, the ugly, the shocking scene and the unfolding of the story are in the opposite side."
There is a keyword "shake" that appears in many of the works of Baizu, but there are many people who see snakes as "a creepy creature."
Some people say they like reptiles in the world, but they don't really like them.
Thus, by the sensibilities of the viewer, "mi" and "biguity" may be a snake.
Also, this creature has been worshipped as a living creature that has a high spiritual power since ancient times, and the house where the "white snake" is living is said to be good luck.
In 1965, there is a series of "Mother Girl" and "The Girl."
It is the market for women who have a shadow.
If you say Imadoki, would you like to say "Cool Buti" type? ...I feel like it is common to girls who appear in the picture.
Among them, "Orochi," the main character of "Orochi," which was serialized in "Orochi" from 1969 to 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be regarded as the representative of Baizu's work, but it is reminiscent of a snake somewhere, such as deep sleep every hundred years to keep eternal life and eternal youth.

"The real culprit who attacked Saudi oil facilities" - Yahoo! News
"The Iranian drone "Aba Beer," which was used in this bombing, has improved dramatically by analyzing the drones of the U.S. forces that crashed in recent years.
It can be manufactured cheaply, and it is about 1000 km long.
In order to fly low air, it is also a strength that is difficult to capture radars."
On 14 September, the largest oil company in Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization of Yemen's "Fushi faction" issued a statement.
"There is no doubt that the President of the Fusi faction is Iran, led by President Lauhani, that Iran cannot allow Saudi Arabia to make crude oil in a situation where their country cannot export crude oil," said Sugawara, an international political analyst.
In response to the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production stopped and oil prices reached 15%.
There is also a voice that oil shocks come back.
"I don't want to avoid military interventions, at least until the U.S. withdrawal from the Middle East is over, at least until the next year's election ends," said Trump, "I'm sure Iran will continue to bomb drones in the hideout of the Fushi faction, but the U.S. will not endure forever."
The U.S. and Iran's "Portuguese War" are facing an immediate crisis.
The reason why YouTuber became a regular employee.
(Biz SPA!)

YouTuber is now very popular among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use their own products for advertising, but there are companies that have started to use YouTuber as their employees.
Direct marketing mix (DmMiX), which is the main business of corporate CRM (customer relationship management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, CEO of DmiMiX, spoke to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, who is actually the representative of the subsidiary and staff first adopted by YouTuber.
i want to support young people who work hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is YouTuber adoption?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now, YouTuber's profession has become a dream of many young people.
Elementary school students are entering the top ranking of career rankings that they want to take in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people chasing dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, we adopted young people who follow the dream of becoming YouTuber and wanted to support them.
- Speaking of YouTuber, there is an image that individuals voluntarily post videos, but why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire YouTuber's career, there is a reality that most YouTuber doesn't have a profit like I thought.
There are many creators who make and post videos while working on part-time jobs, as well as those who do not recognize YouTuber as their family.
In this effort, the creators will provide the environment for pay and content production.
We believe that we will support the benefits of YouTuber, who will become unstable at first.

"I hope Korea will return to GSOMIA" - Yahoo! News
On 27 November, the U.S. Secretary-General of the U.S. Secretary-General (Korea and Japan) stated that the Japan-Korea Military Information Comprehensive Protection Agreement (GSOMIA), which expires on 23 November, would like Korea to reconsider and return its decision.
It is unusual that the U.S. officials refer to the reconsideration of GOMIA.
GSOMIA is a foundation for sharing missile launch information and other information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework of protecting military information in Japan and Korea will collapse.
"We can't effectively respond to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged South Korea to return.
"It is essential that Korea and Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, will cooperate in the alliance."
The recent deterioration of the relations between Japan and Korea pointed out that the U.S. national interests would hurt.
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "We will play a positive role to be able to separate Japan and Korea."

[Bad's first half of the race] The world champion Mototo Momota and the strong Zhou Tensei lead one step forward.
Men's singles (Bad × Spice).
In August, the Japan national team won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Badminton and the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland.
Here, we will look back on the first half of the Olympic Games that took place next year's Tokyo Olympic Games from May to August, and look forward to seeing men's singles for the midfield (Mon/Badminton Magazine Editorial Department).
The Badminton Olympic Games, which started in May, digested the top-ranked tournament (Super 500 or more) at the end of the World Championship.
In the first half of the game, he was the second winner of the 4th tournament, Kento Momota and Shutensei of Taiwan.
Taoda won the World Championships, and Shutennari won the Indonesia OOP (S1000) and the high point of the world ranking point, which is directly connected to the Olympic Games.
In addition, Momota also has JapanOP (S750).
The tournament was held in May in the Sdirman Cup (May/China), IndonesiaOP (July/ Results 16) and JapanOP (July) and the World Championships (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only the World Championships were held, so fatigue would not be greater than the war.
In the mid-September quarter, the top-level tournament was held.
Taiwan's ace is strong in fighting.
Young Thai people are also interested!
He also won the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OOP (S500) top tournament, and Shutennari had already won seven competitions.
He joined the local Taipei OP (S300) in September and won the championship.
He is a very strong player who does not want to fight.
There is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament because it was able to win high points in the first half.
Although Zhou Tensei had an impression of lack of explosive power until last year, it was possible to continue his good performance by increasing the stability of the play this year.
For Momota, the world's top ranking, it seems to be a big opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, he left the game in the first half of the season, with a young Ace Cantaphone in Thailand and an Indian cyclone B.
He is a three-player of Unders Antonsen, who is fighting for an isolated army as a European force.
Although Cantaphon did not enter the finals at the top of the competition, he won the top prize in the second season, including entering the top four.

New Charges for Mobile Phones The price reduction in fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new charge plan for the mobile phone company was introduced.
However, it almost ceased to exist.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga said last summer, "There is room to lower about 40%," and despite the high expectations for price reduction, the price competition did not happen.
It is a major factor in the fact that Rakuten's full-scale entry will be sent forward, and the octagonal status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to become an easy-to-use pricing system by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminals, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI (au) announced plans to maximize and half the device.
However, for 100 days, SIM locks can be used by other companies.
NTT DOCOMO is the largest and third-minute terminal for all of its subscribers.
The three companies continue to "outside" to prevent the transfer to other companies.
Regarding SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications stated that it would require immediate termination.
Companies need to respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the construction of a communication network, such as the base station, as planned.
As expected to be a competitive explosive, it looks like a shoulder.
Maybe there was a sweetness of the outlook.
It is not clear when the service starts or charges.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
This change led to the resignation of Secretary of State Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay."
However, I don't think that the government's price reduction will ease the market and encourage sound competition.
The corporate side should develop a customer-oriented competition before it comes out of the government.
The cost system of each company is very complex and it is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Agency called attention to the fact that the device has advertising such as "up to half" and that there is a case that the consumer's burden exceeds half.
We need to make a polite and easy-to-understand explanation so that companies don't make any mistakes.

When the British commander Farrrell caught his side path, he fell in balance.
He went to Tuckle, but was fired.
However, he did not come down from his waist, but he did his upper body, and he had a strong body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other, and the shape of the head pierced.
Farrell was furious and fell.

"It's an insult, and it's not called a tackle."

The results of nine medical studies, including cancer and emergency medical care, analyzed whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes of car, and judged the need to publish hospital names.
The hospital will consider the abolition of the hospital and the transfer of some medical care to other hospitals.
Medical expenses are rapidly increasing in 25 years, when all of the population is over 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set a goal to reduce the number of beds in a hospital in 18 years to 12,000 beds.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute phase" and " acute phase" where nurses are placed thickly and medical expenses, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation for elderly people.
To cope with aging, we need to reduce the number of beds, as well as increase rehabilitation.
In order to reorganize and integrate hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical plan" that defined the number of beds required for 25 years.
Although the state is divided into 339 areas, many local residents and chiefs have maintained a cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.

9 prefectures of the recommended area of pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo!
On 27 September, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced the revision of the anti-demiological guidelines to prevent the spread of livestock-infected diseases, such as pigs, which are not currently recognized.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which are confirmed to be infected with pigs and wild boars.
The movement of live pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccination is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is accepted.
After public comments (approval of opinions) etc., we aim to complete the procedure in October.
By using vaccines and accepting extracurricular distributions such as meat, it is impossible to "clean country" certified by international organizations and may affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan was temporarily suspended.
In the revised draft, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up a recommended area for vaccination based on the opinion of experts on areas where the risk of infection from wild boar to pigs is high.
The prefectural government created a " vaccination program" that summarizes the scope of vaccination, time, number of heads, and how to proceed.
Other seven prefectures that have been raised as recommended areas for vaccination are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
The area is determined to look at the situation once the guidelines are revised.
Moves such as vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and exhaustions are limited to the region in principle.
For meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact on farmers, and it is practically acceptable to distribution outside the area.
To prevent the spread of viruses, we thoroughly process food waste.
In response to the safety of the vaccinated pigs, they also try to prevent the damage caused by the wind.
The revision of the guidelines took place at an open meeting of experts on the same day, and confirmed at the meeting of the Department of Defense and Prevention.
In the future, the prefecture's opinions and public comments will be conducted until October 7, and the new prevention guidelines will be implemented.

how to keep things up
- Are there people who are prone to dementia?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep them in the degree of forgotten.
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be more susceptible to people.
First, Metabo people tend to be prone to dementia.
dementia is one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there is a region that distributes food tickets to the poor, but food that can be purchased by food tickets is a frozen hamburger, pizza and chicken.
Gas and electricity cannot be used, and people living in an environment where they cannot cook.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes an isolated life of lipids and sugar.
In the end, it becomes poverty but obesity, and when you talk about it, you can only see TV, but your body is disabled.
Similar situations can be Japan.
Besides, people who don't think about things and don't work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, we need to read books and think about things from day to day.
