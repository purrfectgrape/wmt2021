Driving at high heels is dangerous!
The accident of a young man's pedal wrong (Auto Messe web) - Yahoo!
A violation of the Road Traffic Law.
It is a big mistake that I think it's just a matter of elderly drivers, although I've been impressed by the increasing number of accident reports due to pedal mistakes, etc.
The number of pedal accident cases by the end of the 1990s The number of cases in the 2015 National Police Agency data was 1080, the highest in the 24th year, and the number of persons aged 75 and over 1032.
It is important to call attention to the younger generation as well as not many elderly people.
Would you like to take your feet fashionable?
Do you take safety?
There is no mention of gender or cause of this data, but the difference between elderly people who are considered to be due to the weakening of the body, such as driving skills and reflexive nerves.In the younger generation, it is considered to be a mistake of brain injury due to other things such as music and conversation.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes by wearing high heels, panps, sandals, mulls, and the dress of the day.
Some people know that there is no need for driving, but there are people who do not think it is troublesome to change, but there are many people who are driving without bad.
However, the operation of high heels and sandal sandals is in conflict with the traffic laws.
One is to ensure that the handle, braking, and other operations are operated, and "Do not drive the accident and harm to the person" Article 70 (regardless of the safety driving obligation).
The other is Article 71 of the Public Security Committee, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the Nuclear-Dofuken Public Security Committee. For example, in Article 12 of the Miyazaki Road Traffic Act, there is a vehicle that prevents the operation of the vehicle (such as a vehicle that does not interfere with the operation of the car, slippers, heels, heels, etc.).
Both nuclear and Dofuken are considered to be violations of driving in the "hakimono", which can hinder driving operations, even until they are not specified as heels.
That's why the operation of the high heels is dangerous.
It is obvious if you think about the basics of pedal operation safely.
For a safe and reliable pedal operation, first fix the legs on the floor and place the legs to become perpendicular to the brake pedal, and then tilt the foot to the right as the point of view when you take the accelerator pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that it does not matter the behavior of the car.
However, in the heel heels, the area where the cacata is placed on the floor is small, and it is always globed, and the angle is attached to the entire leg at the height of the heel, so the area of the foot placed on the pedal is small and it is difficult to adjust the fine.
It is thought that this will lead to danger.
Most of the cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull up with a high firefowl, and the pedals are not attached to the cover when it comes to a sudden braking, and the heel is pulled off, and it may be impossible to turn off at the end of the pedal.
In addition, there is an example of the fact that when the pedal is trampled to the back side of the pedal, the accelerator pedal was not returned.

We came here and gave up the continuation of the project and this was the measure.

The image of the snake, which is the main image of Kazuo Umezu's girl, is "Mamisu" - Yahoo!
A common point is the mysterious beauty and the facial expression that dwells in the shadow?
Since the 1950s, he has been sending numerous works to the world, and in August 2019, the original "Mizu Kazuo Girl Collection" was released, which focuses on Mr. Kazuo Umezu, who is known as the first person of the horror manga.
When you look at it in your hands, you will notice the correlation between the "beautiful" and " horror" of Kazuo Umeda's work.
Is it attractive because there is a shadow?
There are five girls of Kazuo Umezu.
In addition to the Women's Collection Award, there was a part of "The beauty of the girls who are in the midst of fear, state, and story, but the beauty of the story is also in the opposite direction," but because there is a contrast of the beautiful face distortion and the facial expression of the smiling faces.
There are many things that appear in Kazuo Umezu's work as a "shape" keyword, but the snake has been captured as "awey creature" by the viewer, and there are people who feel "beautiful" and how to receive it.
There are people who love reptiles in the world, but there are people who don't like them.
In such a way, depending on the person's sensibilities, "beauty" and "squake" can be said to be a "shape."
Also, the animals have been planted as a living creature that has a high spiritual power since ancient times, and the house with the "white snake" is said to be auspicious.
In the work of Umezu, which focuses on the snake, there is a series of "The Snake Girl" and "Madara Girl" in 1965.
It is the market that it is a beautiful woman with a shadow.
If you say it's just right now, you can say "Coolbusty" type and even a house ... I feel like it's a common point of the girls who appear in Umeda's work.
In particular, Oochi, the protagonist of "Orochi" which was serialized in the Weekly Shonen Sunday in 1969, is a female character that is representative of Umezu's work, but it is reminiscent of a "shape" that is deeply asleep every year to keep eternal life and eternal youth, as well as a mysterious part of the forces.

On September 14th, Saudi Arabia's largest oil company, Saudi Aramiko, was bombed by ten military drones.
Immediately after this, the anti-government organization of Yemeni, Fushiha, has announced a rebellious life.

YouTuber, which is one of the most popular among young people, is now very popular.
It is not uncommon for companies to make use of their products to advertise their products, but there are companies that have started a rare system called " YouTuber adoption", which is adopted as employees in their own company.
It is a direct marketing mix (hereinafter referred to as "DmMiX"), which is the main business of the company's CRM "Customer Relations Management".
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
This time, I asked Mr. Yusuke Kobayashi, Representative Director of DmMiX, who is actually the representative of the company's subsidiary and staff first, who was adopted by YouTuber.
YouTuber We would like to support young people who want to play a role in supporting young people who are young.
What is the system of adopting YouTuber in the first place?
Yusuke Kobayashi (hereinafter, Kobayashi): Now the occupation of YouTuber has become a longing for many young people.
The number of elementary school students is also higher in the future employment ranking, and the number of young people will continue to increase.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who have dreamed of bandman and comedians.
In the same way, we adopted young people who are dreaming of becoming a YouTuber, and the use of support is " YouTuber adoption".
What is YouTuber?There is an image that the individual voluntarily posts the video, but why did you think to adopt it?
Kobayashi : While a lot of young people are eager to become a profession called YouTuber, most YouTubers have a reality that they don't get revenue like they thought.
There are also a few creators who are making video and posting while working as a part-time job, and creators who can not admit the existence of YouTuber to their families.
In this project, we will provide an environment for creators to pay and create content.
At first, we believe that we will support our activities by supporting the benefits of the occupation of YouTuber, which will be a very unstable position.

And since Sidecar is a seasonal feature of Apple, it is expected to be superior to the more complete " or response".
There are also rumors about the magnetic MacBook Pro, which is equipped with a 16-inch display, but first of all, I want to experience this next-generation macOS.

(Nakamura Yasunori).
(The first race of the Bado Olympic race) The world champion, Momotaro, and the principal's weekly incarnation lead a step forward!
Men's Singles < Men's Singles < "Bodox Spirit!
The Japanese national team won six medals at the 25th World Championships in Basel, Switzerland, which took place in early September, and will take part in the China's OP, which started on 17th.
Here, we look back on the first half of the season from May to August, which started the Olympic Games in Tokyo next year.
The badminton marathon race, which started in May, was the top-ranked tournament (Super 500 or more) which was held at the end of the World Championship.
In the first half of the tournament, he played the second prize in the four competitions, and was one of Taiwan's four winners.
Momota is the world championship and the winner of the tournament is Indonesia's OP "S1000" and the high point of the "World Ranking Point", which is directly connected to the Olympic race.
On the other hand, Momota is also working at Japan OP (S750) as well.
The tournament, which has been held since May, has four competitions: the Group's S dillman Cup (May/China), the Indonesian OP (July 16), Japan OP (July), and the World Championship (August).
Compared to other top players, the number is small, but the schedule is limited to the burden on the body.
August was only one of the world championships, so it would not be much more than the time of the race.
Since September, the high-level competitions will be held in the middle line.
Ace in Taiwan that is strong on the line.
I'm also interested in young people in Thailand!
The winner of the tournament at the top of Indonesia's OP and Thailand OP (S500) has already competed in seven competitions.
He also took part in the local Taipei OOP (S300) in the 9th month of the month and won a splendid victory.
Originally, the physical is strong, and the player who does not have the line.
Even after the tournament, there is no big problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, it would be easier to adjust the schedule of the tournament that will take place in the future by winning high points in the first half.
It was the impression that it was the explosive force until last year, but this year, the stability of the play surface increased, making it possible to continue the construction of the seats firmly.
For Momota, the world's number one, it seems that he has become a more than ever.
Other than these two players, they left the results in the first round of the first round.
And as a European tax, it is the three-seater of Anas Anton Sen.
While it is not possible to advance the finals at the top of the tournament, Kantafon has the power to proceed to the top, such as entering the best four in the two competitions.
There is still a rough side, but the rally of the top players and the Taito is 20 years old (21 years on the 18th) seems to be the presence of the Olympic race, which has the potential to leap forward.
In addition, Cai Planneys B., one step out of India, where they have a high-ranking player.
It is necessary to note the Indian resistance after the mid-middle line, as the Samirbarama, Pranoi H.S. and Surkans Dambi, which are behind the kegae, are coming up in the future.
New charges in a fair competition in the form of a new form: Hokkaido Shimbun
Revision of the Telecommunications Business Law In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was launched.
However, it was almost stopped.
It was said that the Secretary of the Secretary of the Governor of the Kangiii said that there was room for about 40 percent to lower the price.
Rakuten's full-scale entry is ahead, and it is a major factor that the three major companies continue their river states.
It is desirable for consumers to become a cost system that is easy to use by fair competition.
We would like to ask for the efforts of each mobile company.
The amended law prohibits the set discount for the terminal and communication fee.
This is because instead of the number of terminals, the communication volume was set to be reduced.
SoftBank and KDDI announced a plan to make the terminal a maximum of half an hour.
However, the "SIM Lock" is a system for terminals that can not be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT DOCOMO will be the maximum of three terminals for only the contractor of the company's line.
The three companies seem to continue to "contract" to prevent transfer to other companies.
Regarding the SIM lock, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced the policy that it would require immediate termination.
It is necessary for companies to respond quickly.
The postponement of Rakuten was that the maintenance of communication networks, such as base stations, was not going on as planned.
As it was expected to become an explosive material for the reduction competition, it was a cool breeze that was wearing a shoulder.
There was a sweetness of the outlook.
There is no clear indication of the timing and fee of the full-scale service.
As a company that plays a role in social infrastructure, I want to work on the business with responsibility.
The statement by the Secretary of the Secretary of the Secretary of the Secretary of the Secretary of the Kanban led to the opening of the meeting.
Mr. Kan expressed his dissatisfaction with the three company's new charges, "I think the competition will start in the future.
However, I don't think that "drying down" will drive the market and encourage a healthy competition.
It is worth noting that in front of the government, the company must develop a customer's competition.
The charge system of each company is very complex and the comparison is not easy.
While the terminal is advertising such as "to become the maximum amount of money", the Consumer Agency called attention as there is a case where the consumer's burden exceeds half the price.
We have to be careful and easy-to-understand explanations so that we don't have the misunderstanding of our customers.

"Traditional and intense play" - Yahoo! News
U.S. FL Qualgaraf play, the former representative of England, "I don't call a tackle".
The Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan tournament was held on the 26th of the 26th, and the United States, which was the last in twenty countries, was a toast at 7-45 in England.
Although it was a black-boshi transmission, it was called a rough play, which was performed byFL John Kuru.
More than a single shot in the face of the opponent with a shoulder tackle.
The actual scene was released by the overseas media as well, and the former English representative was "not to be called as a tackle", "an insult and intense play".
(Video) "An insulting, intense play" and "I want to play overseas!"
More than a single shot, the two military players get in a messy way...The real moment of the "face-risk tackle" played by the U.S. leader Kuru.
The hot investment exceeded the line.
It's 29th in the second half of the year.
The enemy was deeply impressed by the fact that the British Prime Minister Farrell had a somewhat balanced balance when he caught the path.
I went to the tackle, but it was a quail.
However, the state does not occur from the waist, but it causes the body in the upper body.
As a result, the head and head of the opponent are in contact with each other and the shape of each other.
Farrell was violently blown away and fell.
In the play that clearly wrote the legitimacy, the English athlete will take a lecture as a juror.
The two military players gathered together at once and became the first air of the air.
The result of the TMO's "video judgment" is more than one by one with a red card.
While the punishment was a bad face and the pitch was dropped, some of the buzzers asked for a fair play.
rugby competition New Zealand's local media "staff" will be featured in the "Runding W Cup 2019: U.S. players will not be able to play in a fierce game, and the UK will be renamed".
"The Kiln made a fierce shoulder charge on the face of the British star Farrell, and became a multi-layered" says "It became a column by almost two military players."
In the article, we will introduce you to Mr. Ogo Monya, a former British representative and commentator.
"It's an insult, it's hard to say, "It's not to be called as a tackle," he said.
The United States, which bought one game, was able to escape the victory by holding the game in the 81 minute.
However, Hangzhou's play left the poor aftertaste.
On September 26th, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced the 424 hospital name for the first time, which was judged to be "a lack of medical experience" among public hospitals such as public hospitals and public hospitals.
In Fukui Prefecture, the National Hospital of the National Hospital of Awahara City, the National Hospital of Awahara City, the National Hospital of Awahara City Hospital The Oda Hospital in Echizen town of Oda City Hospital The four facilities of Takahama-cho, Wakasa-hama Hospital, were selected.
⇒ 4 hospitals for remodeling (the standard is strange)
In order to prevent medical expenses inflated by the aging population, it is necessary to restructure and integrate with the hospitals in the competing areas, and this was an extraordinary response.
In October, we requested a full-fledged review of restructuring and integration at the target hospital, and we hope to conclude by September next year.
There is no force to force, but due to the anxiety that a short hospital will disappear, local claims and residents' repulsion are expected.
It was announced at the meeting on the same day.
On the 29th and 1% of the entire hospital, there were many hospitals with a relatively small number of beds.
In the prefecture, Niigata (53,7 percent), Hokkaido (48,6 percent), Miyagi (47,5 percent), Yamaguchi (46,7 percent) and Okayama (43,3 percent) were higher in proportion.
The number of targets was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare investigated 1455 hospitals capable of responding to "acute" and "acute" for severe patients, among public hospitals and public hospitals.
We analyzed nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency medical care, and whether the competing hospital would be in the place of "within less than 20 minutes by car", and judged the need for the hospital's name.
In the targeted hospital, we will consider the abolition and the transfer of some medical care to other hospitals.
Medical expenses are expected to increase by more than 75 years of age.
For this reason, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has set the goal of reducing the number of beds in one hospital to 19.1 thousand floors in Japan.
Currently, the number of beds for "high-speed" and "acute" beds, which are used for medical care, is insufficient for elderly people to have high needs for rehabilitation.
In order to respond to the aging population, it is necessary not only to simply reduce the number of beds, but also to increase rehabilitation.
With regard to the reorganization and integration of the hospital, we formulated the Regional Medicine Concept, which stipulates the number of beds required by each hospital in 25 years.
While local governments and medical officials are divided into 339 areas of the country, many local residents and claims have maintained a cautious stance, and discussions have been lacking.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the name of a hospital with a poor track record, which would lead to the revitalization of discussions.

9 recommended areas of the recommended area for pork vaccine - Yahoo!
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries issued an amendment to the Trade Guidelines that allow the vaccination to the currently not recognized use pigs, in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as pigs.
The target area is selected by nine prefectures such as Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, where the infection of pigs and wild boar is confirmed.
The movement of living pigs and fertilized eggs is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is permitted.
Through public comments to the general public, such as the "Approximate yeast", we aim to complete the procedure in the middle of October.
By using the vaccine, it is possible that it will become a "normal country" that has been certified by the International Organization by the recognition of the spread of meat, etc., and will affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of last September, Japan was in a state where the country's status was temporarily pending.
In the revised draft, in view of the experts' opinions on the areas where the risk of infection from wild boar to pigs, the brainstroke set the recommended area for vaccination.
The target prefecture will create a " vaccination program" that summarizes the range of vaccinations, time, headcount, and direction, and allow the use by the governor to confirm the award.
The other seven prefectures that have been raised as a recommendation for vaccination are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, and Shiga.
When the guidelines are revised, the local government will determine the situation again.
In principle, the movement of pork, semen, fertilization, body, etc., is restricted to the region.
With regard to meat and processed goods, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the influence of farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute to the outside.
Since the virus does not spread, the process of food waste is thoroughly done.
In response to the safety of the ingested pork, we also work to prevent the damage of the hood.
The amendments to the Guidelines were made at the meeting of the Trade Counter Headquarters, which was held on the same day.
In the future, the Government will introduce the opinions and public comments to the prefecture until October 7th, and implement the new trade guidelines.

"Don't need money" - Yahoo!
9/28 (Saturday) 2:57 Delivery
In the last year, he spoke about Melbourne Biquit at the Australian A League, where he was surprised by the fact that he was currently an independent figure, the MF Honda Motor Co., Ltd.
(Video) Honda Keiyo, actually, did you come to the game?
The truth of the scripture is revealed.
Honda, who updated his own Twitter at the end of the day on the 27th of Japan, said, "Please give an offer.I don't need money, but I need to play with a great team or a great teammate."
The other person who sent the reverse offer is Manchester United, the world's prestigious.
Why did Honda have a magnificent request for a club that is one of the premier leagues in the Premier League?
It was published on the 24th of the Australian edition of FOX Sport.
In the article titled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could grab in the equipment of the injured", five independent players were picked up.
There was also the name of Honda among the players such as Tenmu Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfd Bonnie.
At present, U.S., injured persons such as MF Paul Pogba, DFD Luke Show, DF Eric Billy, FWAN Tony Mardi, and FW Marcus Rushford are in an emergency situation.
The red demon, led by the director of Ore Gunner Surusha, was forced to slide two wins in the league and suffer from two wins.
Therefore, it was Honda that the media in Australia named it as a fresh candidate for the tail.
In the article, "The Honda contract as a creative side player, rather than a house bus toriker, can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Pereira."
The score for the 18-game match at Melbourne Bichristy is "a serious record," but the 33-year-old Honda has pointed out that he needs to be away from his entertainment to manage Cambodia's representative.

Today's caddie best shot
One W shot is not necessarily low-up and not lost.
When you want to earn a distance by the second one of the five, you can hit the ball on the ground, and the so-called "Dura" technique.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, so the ball is accompanied by the risk of tilting, but there are players who practice this frequently on the ground.
The first victory of the tour is the Ikemura Hiroshi.
The 24th year of the Pro7 year is now the 7th place in the Driving Detention Division, with a height of 166 cm and petite.
On the other hand, one of the challenges was the fairwaywood system.
In spring, the shot of the "pon 3W" was bad, so I thought I would like to try the Naodra.
From the practice round to the lawn in the area of the area, the ball is dropped and it is also possible to turn 1W into a basket.
In the case where Big Carry is required, it can be used in a variety of ways, but the two sides are effectively used in the small hall.
"It is possible to use the hall to become a place where the eyes are broken down."
In the ballistic measurement machine, Carry recorded 270yd to 280yd.
"I don't have 3W, so I don't have to worry about it, but I'm sure that you can rest assured that it's just 3W.
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only one W in the caddy bag.
The second long club is the loft of 17 degrees.
The guide who is also surprised by the tour's friends is also happy to hear the easy voice from the bottom gallery.
Is the pelvis "to the level of the club"?
"Even if you hit the down blow or on the upper, you don't fly straight.I go to the right when it's a cut-up.I've been doing a straight run to force the swing of the 1W shot at the time of the "Try Up".
The ball is not caught up and the risk of the slice is accompanied by (so the left side will be kicked off (it is not clear to the left).
It's easy to say, but it's a professional skill that I can't say.

(Video) I come to Japan!
Garcia brain edge shot shot
I thought it would be possible to go by the momentum of the second half, but I wanted to not be able to go well, so it was frustrating.
Did you see the victory in the 6th Eagle, the 7th Bardi?
Even after losing Boggy on the 4th, there were five pars, so if I was thinking about it, the chip-in Eagle came on the 6th.
Even in the seventh edition, Bardi was writing for a chance, but after all, it was frustrating that it was not that late.
What did you get to the tournament?
It was nice to have the fairway kept firmly in the narrow course because it was not good for me.
It was a course where the rough was divided and the opposite eye was separated, and the distance was changed.
What is the difference between the regular tournaments?
I think it's possible to shoot a camera, such as a smartphone.
I had to worry about it at all, but I was filming a video for the gallery.
There were not many other things that changed, but I wanted to play the game with the feeling of "I don't lose to a foreign player" because it was a tournament with fewer Japanese players.
I would like to win another prize because I don't want to aim for a wide range of prize if I don't win more than one prize, and I will try my best to enter the top in the tournament because there is also the ZOZOZO Championship.
What is the way to avoid becoming a dementia and "get something"?
Interviews, Books / Watanabe
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have challenged R&D and have been frustrated by the drug of dementia.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle-related diseases has been elucidated, and it seems that there is a possibility that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle-related diseases can be solved.
I interviewed Professor Shunsuke Otsuki at Kinki University Hospital.
There is no dementia without dementia.
What is the current situation? -While it is expected to prevent dementia or treat it, what is the current situation?
Regardless of the degree of difference between the inheritance of Otsuki and the seriousness of the disease, it is possible that everyone gets older and becomes dementia.
However, it is believed that it will take more than twenty years to develop new dementia drugs.
In some countries outside of Japan, medicine called donepezilla, which is commonly used in Japan, is already out of insurance adaptation, and there is no expectation of a remarkable sensory effect.
On the other hand, death due to infection or accidents has been reduced, and cancer death has decreased due to the remarkable progress of treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is true that the number of patients with dementia is increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by the person or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment that can live comfortably in the region as a whole.
How to make it easier to get it to a certain level.
Is there a person who is easy to become a dementia or a difficult person?
Even if it is inevitable to become a dementia, it is possible to suppress the symptoms as much as possible and to "get" the symptoms.
The dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle-related diseases, and it tends to be easy for people.
First of all, Metabo people tend to be prone to becoming dementia.
The dementia is regarded as one of the lifestyle-related diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol blood.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are areas where food tickets are distributed to poor people, but food that can be used for food tickets is hamburgers and pizzas and chickens that can be saved.
You can't use gas or electricity, and people living in the environment where they can't cook in the first place.
When it comes to a diet with less vegetables and protein, it becomes a life that relies on oil and investment.
When it comes to poverty, it becomes obese, and when you do it, you only see the TV as a daze, the body becomes futile.
There is a similar situation in Japan.
In addition, people who do not think about things or do not work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, you need to think about things by reading books on a daily basis.
