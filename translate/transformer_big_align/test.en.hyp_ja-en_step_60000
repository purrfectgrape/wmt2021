driving at high heels is dangerous!
A number of young people's pedal accident occurred - Yahoo! News
violations of road traffic laws
It's a big mistake that I think it's only a problem with older drivers.
In the case of an accident (2015 National Police Agency data), there are more than 1080 cases in the age of 24 and less than 1032 over 75 years.
The mistake is not always the elderly, but it is important to call attention to the younger generation as well.
do you take a shale on your feet?
is it safe?
This data is not described as gender ratio or cause, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline in the body such as driving skills and reflection nerves, there is a possibility that the young age group has taken care of other things, such as music and conversation, and it may also be a mistake due to wear.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the dress of the day, such as Heathle, Panps, sandals, mulls, and some people drive away.
There are some people who know that it is not suitable for driving, but there are many people who are driving without worrying about the possibility of being dangerous.
However, driving on high heels and sandals violates road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the handle, brake and other operations, Article 70, which stipulates that "No driving should be done to harm people with accidents or accidents."
Another reason is that the driver must comply with the rules set forth by the prefectural government committee, Article 71 of the Public Security Committee, for example, in accordance with Article 12 of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, "Don't wear shoes in a way that hinders the operation of high heels, or hinders driving operations."
In each prefecture, it is similar to the intention to consider a violation of driving in "wearing that could prevent driving operations" even if not specified as Heheel.
So why is the driving in Heheel dangerous?
It is obvious that considering the basics of making pedals safe.
To ensure safe pedal operation, the foot is fixed to the floor and the foot is perpendicular to the brake pedal.
At this time, it is important to keep firmly fixed, regardless of the behavior of the car, or not to Blair.
However, it is difficult to adjust finely because the size of the foot area on the pedal is small and the area surrounding the floor is small, and the height of the heel is always gray and the angle is attached to the entire foot.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull the heel or the heel, and sometimes the pedal is pulled by the heel when it comes to an emergency brake, or the heel is pulled away from the heels and the heel is removed and the heel is pulled into the back of the pedal.
In addition, there is a case where heel pulls the back side of the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

The local industry of Hyogo and Awaji Island, Kinki ceramics in the manufacturing of "Awaji tile" apply for a quasi-self bankruptcy application for debt of about 20 billion yen (Euro Data Bank) - Yahoo! News
The decline in housing prices, and the damage caused by the earthquake, caused the rise in consumer tile roofs.
Kinki Ceramics Co., Ltd. (TDB Companies Code: 530173983, Capital 99.20 million yen, Otani 8881-8, Hyogo Prefecture, Representative Yukizo Fukuhara, and 44 employees) filed for a quasi-self bankruptcy on August 30.
The application representative is Yoshida Earth Law Attorney (Osaka City Kita Ward, Osaka Prefecture; Nishitenmitsu 1-10-8; Yoshida Land Lawyer; Phone 06-665-6038).
The company was founded in June 1895 and was reorganized in April 1961.
At the beginning, he started business as a Ibubu tile manufacturer in Nishizumi-cho, Sanhara County (present-day Minami-Awaji City).
In October 86, he succeeded in the merger of the Co-wa kiln business and the business of the Kinki Industry Co., Ltd., but changed to the current business name and moved to the main office.
After that, the company established a sales base in Fukuyama City, Hiroshima City, Oita City, Miyazaki City, and it became the current system.
The company built a wide range of sales bases in western Japan, including major house manufacturers, building materials trading companies, and roof construction companies.
He was well known as the top tile manufacturer of Awaji Island.
However, due to the decline in housing prices after the Lehman shock, and the damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto Earthquake, demand continued to increase due to the deterioration of the roofs of consumer tiles.
In addition to the decline in profit rates due to the surge in fuel prices, there was a continuous deficit with excessive benefit debt associated with inventory and business fixed investment.
For this reason, financial institutions have been trying to rebuild their business, such as requesting the easing of the repayment conditions for loans, but there is no signs of recovery in the business situation, and it is gradually approaching funding.
I was unable to support the project and decided to continue my business.
The debt is currently under investigation, but it is expected to be around 20 billion yen.

The reason why super personality YouTuber became a positive employee.
(BizSPA!)
9/27 (Fri) 8:47
YouTuber is a very popular among young people.
It is not uncommon for companies to use advertising for their own products, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "Youtuber adoption," which is adopted as a positive employee in their company.
Direct marketing mix (DmMiX), which is the main business of corporate CRM (Customer Relations Management).
What does it mean to adopt YouTuber?
I listened to Mr. Yuki Kobayashi, the representative of the subsidiary and staff first that YouTuber was adopted.
i want to support young people working hard with YouTuber.
What kind of mechanism is the adoption of YouTuber?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now, YouTuber's career has become a dream of many young people.
Elementary school students are also ranked top in the career rankings that want to be active in the future.
Until now, we have adopted and supported young people who are chasing dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, we adopted a young man who is chasing the dream of becoming YouTuber and trying to support them.
But why did you think about hiring?
Kobayashi: While many young people are interested in the profession of YouTuber, most YouTuber is the reality that they don't have the revenue they thought.
There are many creators who are making and posting videos while working part-time, and those who do not recognize the existence of YouTuber to their families.
This initiative provides the environment for paid and content production to the creators employed.
We believe that we will support activities by supporting the benefits of YouTuber, which will become unstable at first.

Napper said, "It is not possible to respond effectively to crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted over the Sea of Japan in July also showed the threat of "the first time in history" and said, "It is essential that the U.S.-Korea, which shares values such as democracy and human rights, will cooperate in the alliance."
The recent deterioration in Japan-Korea relations has pointed out that it hurts the U.S. interests.
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said, "It will play a positive role to fill the gap between Japan and Korea."

Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Although Shutennari was impressed by the lack of explosive power until last year, he was able to continue his good grades by increasing the stability of the play in this year.
For Momota, one of the world's top rankings, it seems to be more difficult than ever.
In addition to these two players, he left the results in the first half of the match against the Thai young Ace Cantaphon and the Indian Cy Planeties B.
He is the third player of the Unders Antonsen, who is struggling with the Europeans.
Although Canteron does not enter the top tournament, he won the top prize in the second round.
There is still a rough face, but the 20-year-old (21-year-old) who has been able to rally against top players may have a huge potential to leap into the Olympic Games.
Cyplanys B. also took a step in India, where he played a single player.
Samir Balama, Pranii H.S., and Suricans Kidambi, who has been delayed due to injury, needs attention to the Indian forces since the mid-season.
New charges for mobile phones.
The new pricing plan for mobile phone companies was introduced in October due to the revision of the telecommunications business law.
However, it was generally stopped.
In the summer of last year, Mr. Yoshihide Suga said, "There is room to lower than 40%," but the price competition did not happen even though expectations for lower prices were high.
It is a major factor in the fact that the real entry of Rakuten has been sent forward, and the presence of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a cost system that is easy to use by fair competition.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits a set discount for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling the terminal, the communication fee was set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make the device up to half.
However, the SIM lock is not available for 100 days with other companies.
NTT Dokomo is one-third of the terminal for only a contract with the company.
The three companies also continue to "interpretation" to prevent changes to other companies.
With regard to SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications agreed to immediately cancel.
The company needs to respond quickly.
The postponement of Rakuten was not due to the development of a communication network such as the base station.
It was hoped that the price reduction competition would be explosive, so it was dressed as a shoulder.
It might have been the sweetness of the outlook.
The start and price of the full-scale service is not clear.
As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
The change in prices led to the remarks by the Secretary of State Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of the three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay to remain."
However, I don't think that the government's price reduction will ease the market and encourage sound competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before the government exits.
The cost system of each company is very complex and is not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention as there were cases where consumer burdens exceeded half of the amount, such as the terminal's up to half the amount.
We must strive to explain politely and easy-to-understand explanations so that companies don't have any misunderstandings of users.

[ Rugby World Cup] I'm going to go out and fight against the U.S. player's face-to-face dangerous tackle.
U.S. FLil is a rough play and former English representative, "It's not a tackle."
The Japan Rugby World Cup (W Cup) was held on 26 July, and the United States finished 7-45 in England.
Although it became a black star, Laf play played by F. John Kyle in the second half is called a wave crest.
In the face of the opponent's face, he dropped out.
The actual scene was released with video, and the former English players complained that it was "not a insult and inferior play."
[Video] "The insult and inferior play" and the overseas wave crest!
it's a real moment of a "face risk tackar" played by the US representative kyle.
The hot fighting force crossed the line.
It is 29 minutes later that I received at 0-38.
In the midst of the enemy, the English chief Farrell fell in balance when he caught his side's path.
I went to Tuckar, but it was Kyle.
However, the upper body was not lower than the waist, and the upper body was severely damaged.
As a result, the person's head and head are in contact with the opponent's head and the shape of the head.
Farrell was furious and fell.
The English player in the play that clearly lacks legitimacy is fiercely protesting as if he finds Kyle.
Both teams gathered at once and became air-conditioned.
As a result of TMO (video judgment), Kyle dropped out of red card.
Bucks later pitched in a bad face, but some of the audience looking for a fair play were also asked.
Rugby's strong local media staff in New Zealand featured the headlines: Rugby World Cup 2019: The U.S. players dropped out of play and England won.
"Kick made a poor shoulder charge on the face of the English star Farrell and became a retreat."
In the article, he introduced a comment by the former English player Hugo Moña.
"It's an insult, and it's not called a tackru, it's a bad play."
The U.S. lost one game in 81 minutes and managed to escape the defeat.
However, Kyle's play left the bad taste.
On September 26, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced the first four24 hospital names to determine that there is no medical record among public hospitals, such as 1455 public hospitals and sun reds nationwide.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Labor verified the medical achievements of 14 public and public hospitals, and four facilities were targeted at the Wakasa-Takahama Hospital in Takahama-cho, Oda Hospital in Echizen-cho, which is the National Hospital Organization of Yawa City.
what is it?
Due to the aging of the population and the expansion of medical costs, the hospital needs to be restructured and integrated into the competitive area, so we decided to respond to an unusual case.
In October, we requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration of the target hospital and decided to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no force, it is expected that local mayors and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that the hospital is not nearby.
It was announced on the same day.
The hospital had a total of 291% and had a relatively small number of beds.
In prefectures, Niigata (53,7 percent), Hokkaido (48,6 percent), Miyagi (47,5 percent), Yamaguchi (46,7 percent) and Okayama (43,3 percent).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Labor conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in response to the "high acute phase" for severe patients and the " acute phase" of general surgery.
Nine medical records, including cancer and emergency care, analyzed whether a competing hospital was located within 20 minutes by car, and judged the need to publish the hospital name.
The hospital is subject to consideration such as abolishing and transferring some medical care to other hospitals.
The cost of medical expenses increased by 25 years, when all of the clustered families were 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set the goal of reducing the number of beds to 119,11,000 beds in hospitals nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute" and " acute" periods where nurses are placed and medical expenses are paid, but there is a shortage of rehabilitation for elderly people.
In order to cope with aging, the number of beds should not only be reduced, but also increase rehabilitation.
In response to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture established a "regional medical concept" that defines the number of beds necessary for 25 years.
The district is divided into 339 districts, and many local residents and chiefs have maintained a cautious stance, and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare wants to promote the revitalization of the discussion by announcing the poor hospital name.

9 prefectures recommended for pig cholera vaccine - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a revision of the anti-defection guidelines to prevent the spread of "porks" in livestock infection, which would enable preventive vaccination against the currently not recognized herbicides.
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed by infection in pigs and wild boars.
The movement of living pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccinations is limited to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is accepted.
After public comments (approval proposals) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October.
By using vaccines and recognizing the distribution of peripherals such as meat, it may not be a "clean country" certified by international organizations and affect the export of pork.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan's status was temporarily pending.
In the revision, the Ministry of Agriculture set up the recommended area for vaccination, based on the opinion of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boars to pigs.
The prefectural government creates a " vaccination program" that summarizes the scope of vaccination, time, number of heads, and how to proceed.
The other seven prefectures are Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga.
When the guidelines have been revised, the area is determined extremely again.
Travels such as vaccination pork, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and exhaustion are restricted in principle.
In terms of meat and processed products, they are not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact of farmers.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
In response to the safety of the infected pork, he is also involved in preventing the damage caused by wind criticism.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized in the meeting of the experts held on the same day, and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Prevention Headquarters.
In the future, the prefecture's opinions and public comments will be conducted until October 7th, and new preventive guidelines will be enforced.

Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "You don't need money, but you need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent "inverse offers" is Manchester United, a world-renowned gate.
Why did Honda have a grand request for the Premier League's most powerful club?
It was published in the Australian edition FOX Sports on 24th.
In an article entitled "The Five FWs" that Manchester United could capture in the crisis of the injury, five players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa and Giuseppe Rossi, Wilfed Bonney, there were also names of Honda.
In the United States, injuries such as the MF Pole Pogba, the DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Martial, and FW Marcus Rushford are now in emergency.
The Red Devil, led by Orlé Gunner Sulcherle, was forced to lose 22 points in the league, and had challenges in the quality of the front line.
Therefore, the Australian media named Honda as a new candidate for the Tecot.
In the article, "It's not strictly a striker, but as a creative side player, Honda's contract can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Perilla."
"The 33-year-old Honda, who is 33 years old, needs to take full attention from his entertainment to manage Cambodian representative."

Ikemura Kanyo, who is now Naora's name, doesn't need to worry about it?
caddy's best shot today.
1W shot is not always tipping and hitting.
There is also a technique called " Naodra," which is so-called when you want to earn distance in the second round of Per5.
As the current 1W has a large head volume, there is a risk that the ball is scattered, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze, who is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
The 24-year-old is 166 cm tall and is currently 7th in the driving direction category (average 304.02 yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
"I thought I would try Naodra because I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W) before spring."
From the practice round, you can drop the ball on the lawn of the Ti area and draw 1W away.
In the case where Big Care is required, it is used to increase the tiup, but both sides are used to effectively utilize Naodra in narrow halls.
"You can use the hall where the eye line is pushed down."
He recorded 270 yd to 280 yd in carrie.
"So I don't need 3W.Caddy is more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the caddy bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.
The battle method surprised by the tour fellows is also happy to hear the feeling of leaking from the gallery.
The trick is to "do the club at the level ( horizontal)."
"Even if you hit the top, you can't fly straight, and you're going to right with a cut track.It was originally a direct drag to correct the swinging of 1W shots, and the attack angle (the club's entrance angle) will be moderate."
The ball is not caught and the risk of slices is accompanied by "So the left side can be removed (not bent left).
It's a professional technique that makes sense.

I thought I could go to that momentum in the second half of the year, but I couldn't get it well, so I regret it.
Did you see the sixth eagle, the seventh bardy win?
Even after I hit Boggy on the 4th, there were only 5 people left, so if I had a feeling of returning, I had a chip-in eagle on the 6th.
In the seventh place, Bardy was able to get a chance, but it was regrettable that he couldn't continue in the second half.
what are you doing here?
I'm glad that Fairway was able to make a solid key even in a narrow course.
It was a course where the roughness and the reverse were separated and the distance was changed.

It was possible to shoot a camera (such as a smartphone).
I didn't care at all, but I was filming videos.
I didn't have any other changes, but I was just co-hosted with a few Japanese players, so I came to the game with the feeling of "no loss to overseas players."

One of the major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals is dementia drugs that have failed to challenge R&D.
However, it is clear that the relationship between dementia and lifestyle is being elucidated and it may be possible to keep extremely mild and forgotten.
Kinki University Hospital A stroke center Professor Toshisuke Otsuki talked to me.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference between mildness and severity.
However, it is still considered that new dementia drugs have been developed for more than 20 years.
The drugs that are commonly used in Japan are already outside insurance adaptations in some countries overseas.
On the other hand, the death of infectious diseases and accidents has decreased, and cancer deaths have been declining due to severe advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
This is why dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment where society can live with peace.
how to keep things up
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia and who is difficult to become?
Otsuki Even if you are inevitable to become dementia, there is a possibility that you can suppress the symptoms as much as possible and keep the symptoms as possible.
dementia is thought to be one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to be an easy person.
First, people in metabol tend to become dementia.
dementia is one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol.
It also affects the presence of economic power.
For example, in the U.S. there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food that can be purchased by food tickets is a frozen hamburger, pizza and chicken.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people living in an environment where they can't cook.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes an isolated life of lipids and sugars.
In the end, it is poverty, but it becomes obesity, and if you look at TV, you will be able to see it.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who don't think about things or don't work tend to become dementia.
In other words, in order to prevent dementia, it is necessary to read books from day to day.
