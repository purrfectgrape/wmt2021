driving at high heels is dangerous!
Yahoo! News
Road Traffic Act violations
It's a big mistake to think that it's only a problem with older drivers.
The number of years-old pedal accident cases (2015 Police Agency data) exceeded 1032 cases over 75 years of age.
It is important to call attention in the same way as the younger generation.
do you take your feet?
is it safe?
This data is not described as gender ratio or cause, but unlike the elderly who are often considered to be due to the decline in the body such as driving skills and reflexive nerves, there is a possibility that the young age group will be distracted by other things such as music and conversation, and it may be a mistake due to clothes.
In particular, women choose a variety of shoes depending on the clothes of the day, such as high heels, panps, sandals, mulls, and so on.
Some people know that it is not suitable for driving, but some people are worried about changing their shoes.
However, driving on high heels and sandals is in conflict with road traffic laws.
One is to ensure the operation of the handle, brakes and other operations, and Article 70, which stipulates that "No driving should be made to harm people with accidents."
Also, in Article 71, which stipulates that the driver must comply with the matters stipulated by the prefectural Public Safety Commission, for example, in the Rules of Enforcement of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Act, "I wear shoes that hinder the operation of high heels, or wear them in a way that hinders the operation of the vehicle.
The aim of each prefecture as a violation of the operation of a footwear that could prevent operation is not specified as high-heel.
So why is it dangerous to drive at high heels?
It is obvious that it is based on safe pedal operation.
To ensure safe pedal operation, the foot is fixed to the floor and the foot is perpendicular to the brake pedal.
At this time, it is important to firmly fix the car without any car's behavior.
However, it is difficult to adjust finely because the height of the heel is small and the area surrounding the floor is always small.
This may lead to danger.
In addition, most cars have floor carpets, but this material is easy to pull whether it is a high heel or not, and sometimes the heel is pulled by the heel when it comes to emergency braking, and the heel is removed from the heels to the back of the pedal.
There is also a case where the heel pulls to the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and the accelerator pedal disappears.

five beautiful girls of Baizu' works.
In the chapter of "The Beauty Collection," there was a statement that "The beauty of the women in the extremes of fear, uglyness, and the shocking scenes of the story stand out," but because there is a contrast between the beautiful faces, distortions, and the feelings of resentment ..., there may be more "folence."
There is a keyword called "the snake" in many works, but there are various types of people who see it as "the creepy creature" or those who feel "the beautiful."
Some people say they like reptiles in the world, but they don't really like them.
Thus, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "mi" and " ugly" may be a snake.

There is a biographical work about the snake in 1965 with a series of "Mama Kowashi!" and "Later Girl."
It is the market for women with shadow.

Among them, Orochi, the main character of Orochi, which was serialized in "Shonen Sunday" from 1969, is a beautiful girl character that can be regarded as the representative of Baizu's work.

"It's no doubt that President Rohani's leadership is Iran, and Iran cannot forgive that Saudi Arabia is making crude oil under the circumstances that their country cannot export crude oil," said Sugawara, an international political analyst.
After the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's total oil production stopped, and oil prices increased by 15%.
There is also a voice that the oil shock returns.

What kind of mechanism does YouTuber adopt?
Yuki Kobayashi: Now, YouTuber's career has become a long-standing youth.
Elementary school students are also ranked top in the vocational rankings that want to be active in the future.
Until now, we have adopted young people chasing dreams such as bandman and comedians.
In the same way, we will adopt young people who are chasing the dream of becoming YouTuber and support them.
But why did you decide to adopt YouTuber?
Kobayashi: While many young people admire the job of YouTuber, most YouTuber have a reality that they don't have the revenue they thought.
There are many creators who are producing and posting videos while working part-time, and creators who do not recognize their family as YouTuber.
In this effort, we will provide the environment for paid and content production for creators who are employed.
At first, we hope to support our activities by supporting YouTuber's career.

In response to a single interview with the U.S. Ambassador's residence in Tokyo on 27 November, Napper said, "We hope Korea will reconsider its decision and return to Korea."
It is unusual for U.S. officials to reexamine the destruction of GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is based on the agreement between Japan, the U.S., and the U.S. to share missile launch information.
In August, Korea announced that it would destroy Japan's agreement, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Korea will collapse.
Napper said, "I can't respond effectively to the crisis without GSOMIA."
"There is time to expire," he urged Korea to return.
The joint flight training conducted over the Sea of Japan in July also indicated the threat of "the first time in history."
In recent years, the deterioration in relations between Japan and Korea has pointed out that it will hurt US national interests.
"There is no intention of intermediation," he said.

[The first half of the Bado Olympic race] World Champion Mototo Momota and the strong Zhou Tensei lead a step!
Men's singles (Bad × Spie).
The Japan national team won six medals at Badminton's Big Event in August and the 25th World Championship (Switzerland Basel) in early September.
Here, we look back at the first half of the race from May to August next year's Tokyo Olympic Games, and we look forward to men's singles in the mid-season (Mon/Badminton Magazine Editor).
Starting in May, Badminton's Olympic Games were digested by the top athletes (Super 500 or more) at the end of the World Championship.
In the first half of the match, Kento Momota, who won the second round of four races, and Zhou Tensei in Taiwan.
Momota won the World Championship, Zhou Tensei, Indonesia's OP (S1000) and the World Ranking Point, which is directly connected to the Olympic Games.
Momota also has JapanOP (S750).
The tournament will be held in May (May/China), Indonesia OP (July / Results 16), JapanOP (July), and the World Championship (August).
Although there are few other top players, it is a schedule to reduce the burden on the body.
In August, only one World Championship was held, it would not be much more fatigue than during the war.
From September onwards, it is necessary to make good results in the mid-term competition.
Ace in Taiwan, which is resistant to fighting.
Young people in Thailand!
At the same time, Sutennari, who won the top tournament of the Indonesia OP and the Thailand OOP (S500), has already played seven games.
In September, he joined the local Taipei OP (S300) and won the championship.
He is a very strong player who does not want to fight.
After the tournament, there is no major problem in the performance of the game.
Rather, by winning high points in the first half of the game, it would be easier to adjust the schedule for the upcoming tournament.
Although Zhou Tensei had an impression of lack of explosive power until last year, he was able to continue his good grades by increasing the stability of the play in this year.
For Momota, one of the world's top rankings, he seems to be a big opponent than ever.
In addition to these two players, he left the results in the first half of the match against the Thai young Ace Cantaphon and the Indian Cy Planets B.
He is the third player of Unders Antonsen, who is struggling with the European Union.
Although Canteron does not enter the finals at the top of the tournament, he won the top in the second round.
Although there is still a rough side, the 20-year-old (21-year-old) who was able to rally against top players seems to have a huge potential to leap into the Olympic race.
Cy Planety B. also took a step in India, where he played singles with good players.
Samir Baluma, Prano H.S., and Srikans Kidambi, who has been delayed due to injury, need to be aware of the Indian forces after the mid-middle war.
New rates on mobile phones, price reductions at fair competition: Hokkaido Shimbun
In October, a new fee plan for a mobile phone company was introduced to the enforcement of the telecommunications business law.
However, it generally stopped.
Mr. Yoshihide Suga said that in the summer of last year, there was room for less than 40%.
It is a major factor that Rakuten's full-scale entry has been sent ahead and the oligor status of three major companies continues.
It is desirable for consumers to be a fair competition that is easy to use.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile companies.
The amendment prohibits set discounts for terminal and communication charges.
Instead of selling terminals, communication fees were set to increase.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make the device up to half.
However, it is a mechanism for SIM locks that cannot be used by other companies for 100 days.
NTT Docomo makes the terminal for only a third of its own contract.
The three companies continue to "enclose" to prevent transfer to other companies.
With regard to SIM locks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that it would require immediate termination.
The company must respond quickly.
The delay in Rakuten was not due to the development of communication networks such as base stations as planned.
It was hoped that the price reduction competition would be explosives, so it was worn on the shoulder.
I wonder if there was a sweetness of the outlook.

As a company responsible for social infrastructure, I would like to work on business with responsibility.
This revision led to the announcement by the Secretary of State Suga.
Mr. Suga complained about the new charges of three companies: "I think the competition will start in the future, and I don't think it's okay to remain."
However, I don't think the government's price reduction will ease the market and encourage healthy competition.
The company should develop a customer-oriented competition before the government exits.
The cost system of each company is very complex and not easy to compare.
The Consumer Affairs Agency called attention as there were cases where consumer burdens exceeded half of the total amount of advertising such as "maximum half."
Companies must try to explain politely and easy to understand so that they don't make mistakes.

The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare announced on September 26 that it was the first hospital name of 424 that the public hospitals, such as 1455 public hospitals and sunreds, were deemed to have poor medical results.
In Fukui Prefecture, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare examined the results of the treatment of 14 public and public hospitals.
it's not the standard.
In order to suppress medical expenses expanding due to aging, we have to encourage reorganisation and integration with hospitals in conflict areas.
In October, he requested a full-scale review of reorganization and integration at the target hospital and decided to conclude by September next year.
Although there is no compulsory force, it is expected that local mayors and residents will be repulsed due to anxiety that the nearby hospital will disappear.
It was released on the same day.
The hospital had a total of 291%, with a relatively small number of beds.
In prefectures, Niigata (53, 7 percent), Hokkaido (48, 6 percent), Miyagi (47,5 percent), Yamaguchi (46.7%), Okayama (43.3%).
The number of subjects was 54 in Hokkaido, and Okinawa was only zero.
Based on data from FY2017, the Ministry of Labor conducted a survey of 1455 hospitals in response to the "high acute phase" for severe patients.
Nine medical records, such as cancer and emergency care, analyzed whether competing hospitals were located within 20 minutes of car, and judged the need for public health.
The hospital will be considered to be abolished and some medical departments will be transferred to other hospitals.
Medical expenses have increased rapidly in 25 years, when all of the population is 75 years old.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labor has set a goal to reduce the number of hospital beds to 1191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, there are many beds in the "high acute phase" and " acute phase" where nurses are carefully placed and medical expenses are taken, but there is a shortage of high rehabilitation needs for the elderly.
In order to cope with aging, the number of beds is not only reduced but also increased for rehabilitation.
In response to the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each prefecture formulated a "regional medical concept" that defines the number of beds required for 25 years.
The district is divided into 339 districts, with local governments and medical officials discussing, but many local residents and mayors maintain their cautious stance and discussions are difficult.
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare wants to promote debate by publishing a hospital name that is not proven.

Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries ( Gifu Shimbun Web) - Yahoo! News
On the 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced a revision of the anti-demiological guidelines to prevent the spread of livestock infectious disease "tann cholera."
The target area will select nine prefectures, including Gifu, Aichi Prefecture, which have been confirmed by pigs and wild boars.
The movement of living pigs and fertilized eggs in vaccines is restricted to the region, but the distribution of meat and processed products is recognized.
After public comments (approval opinions) to the general public, we aim to complete the procedure in October.
By using vaccines and recognizing the distribution of meat and other regions, it is possible to influence the export of pork without being certified by international organizations.
Since the outbreak of September last year, Japan's status was temporarily suspended.
Based on the opinion of experts, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries set up the recommended area for vaccination, based on the opinions of experts on areas with high risk of infection from wild boars.
The prefectural government will create a " vaccination program" that summarizes the range of vaccinations, times, heads, and how to proceed.
Other seven prefectures, including Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Mie and Shiga, have been raised as recommendations for vaccination.
The area is determined very once the guidelines have been revised.
Transfers such as infusion pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, corpses, and exhaustives are restricted in principle.
For meat and processed products, it is not subject to the cost of distribution restrictions and the impact of farmers, and it is virtually acceptable to distribute them outside the region.
To prevent viruses from spreading, we thoroughly process food waste.
They also appeal to the safety of the infected pigs and try to prevent damage to the wind.
The revision of the guidelines was summarized at the meeting of experts held on the same day, and confirmed at the meeting of the Anti-Defection Headquarters.
In the future, opinions and public comments from prefectures will be conducted until October 7, and new preventive guidelines will be enforced.
Keisuke Honda, who is not affiliated, is an open approach to ManU!
"We don't need money" ( Football Channel) - Yahoo! News
9/28 (Sat) 2:57
As of last season, he left Melbourne Victorie, Australia's A League, and Keisuke MFMOTODA, the former Japan national team, was making an amazing move.
[Video] Keisuke Honda was actually in the game?
the truth of heaven is revealed.
Honda, who updated his Twitter at midnight on 27th Japan Time, said, "We don't need money, but we need to play with great teams and great teammates."
The other person who sent "reverse offers" is Manchester United, the world's largest gate.
Why did Honda make a grand request for the premier club?
It was published in the Australian edition FOX Sports on 24 October.
In the article titled "The Five FWs that Manchester United could seize in the aftermath of the injury," five unbeatable players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa and Giuseppe Rossi and Wilfed Bonney were the names of Honda.
In the United States, injuries such as the MF Pole Pogba, the DF Luke Show, DF Eric Bailey, FW Antony Martial, and FW Marcus Rushford have been in emergency situations.
The "Red Devil" led by Orlé Gunner Sulscherle was forced to win 22 games in the league, and had problems with the quality of the front line.
Thus, the Australian media named Honda as a new candidate for Teco.
In the article, "The contract of Honda as a creative side player rather than a striker can be filled with holes filled by Andreas Perilla."
"The 33-year-old Honda had to leave his entertainment to manage Cambodia's representative and take full attention."
What is the approach of Honda?
For the next year's Tokyo Olympics to be held in Tokyo, it is also noteworthy that United will move.

Now, Naodra's name, Kanyo IKEMURA, doesn't need to hit first?
today's caddy's best shot.
One W shot is not always tipping.
There is also the so-called " Naodra" technique that you want to make a ball on the ground when you want to earn a distance in the second round of par 5.
Recently, 1W has a large head volume, and there is a risk that the ball is scattered, but there are players who practice it frequently on the ground.
Ikemura Kanze is waiting for the first victory of the tour.
At the age of 24, he was 166 cm tall and is currently 7th (average 304.02 yd).
One of the challenges was the accuracy of Fairwaywood.
At the beginning of spring, I thought I would try Naodra because I couldn't shoot a spoon (3W).
From the practice round, you can drop the ball on the lawn of the Ti area, and also sprinkle 1W.
In the case where big carrie is required, it is used to increase the amount of tiup, but both sides are used in narrow halls and so on.
"You can use the hall where the eye line hits."
He recorded 27yd to 280 yd at Carrie.
"So I don't need 3W.Caddy is more secure than 3W."
From the Japan Tour Championship in June, Wood is only 1W in the Cady bag.
The second longest club is Loft 17 degrees UT.
The battle method surprised by the tour fellows is also happy to hear the loss from the gallery.
The trick is to "do the club to level."
"But even if you hit the top, you can't fly straight.I'm going to the right with a cut track.It was originally a direct drag to correct the swing of 1W shots (at the time of tiup).
If the ball doesn't catch, it is accompanied by the risk of slices, "So the left side can be removed (not bent on the left).
It's a professional technique that I don't know.

I thought it would be possible to reach the momentum in the second half of the year, but it was regrettable that the patter could not grow well.
Did you see the sixth Eagle, seventh bardy?

But it was regrettable that Bardy was not able to continue in the second half.
what did you get to this tournament?

What is the way to prevent dementia and keep things forgotten?
Interviews and Letters/WATANABE Yo
Major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals have failed to challenge R&D.
However, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle has been elucidated, and it seems that it is possible to remain extremely mild and forgotten.
Dr. Toshisuke OTSUKI spoke to the Kinki University Hospital.
there's no dementia.
What is the current situation?
Otsuki There is a difference between mildness and severity.
However, it is still thought that it takes more than 20 years to develop new dementia drugs.
The drugs used in Japan are already outside insurance adaptations in some countries overseas, and the outstanding completion effect cannot be expected.
On the other hand, deaths due to infectious diseases and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have been declining due to intense advances in treatment such as anticancer drugs.
Therefore, it is also true that dementia patients are increasing.
It is not only possible to solve the problem by yourself or family, but it is necessary to establish an environment where society can live safely.
how to keep things up
Is there anyone who is prone to dementia or who is hard to become?
Otsuki Even if it is inevitable to become dementia, it is possible to suppress symptoms as much as possible and keep them in the degree of forgetting.
dementia tends to be one of the lifestyle diseases and people who are more likely to be.
First, people in metabol tend to become dementia.
dementia is one of lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol.
It also affects economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are regions where food tickets are distributed to the poor, but food that can be purchased by food tickets is stored frozen hamburgers, pizzas and chickens.
It is not possible to use gas or electricity, and people living in environments that cannot be cooked in the first place are available.
Then, it becomes a diet with less vegetables and protein, and it becomes a life of fat and sugar.
At the end of the year, it is poverty but obesity, and if you're talking about it, you can't see TV.
Similar situations can be Japan.
In addition, people who don't think things or don't work tend to become dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, we need to read books from day to day and think about things.
